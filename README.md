# PyTorch machine learning GPU inference using Docker and Flask

![png](pytorch-docker.png)

This project illustrates how to serve a PyTorch model as a REST API using a simple CIFAR model for illustration from
the [PyTorch CIFAR tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html).

This is done using Flask, Docker and PyTorch.
